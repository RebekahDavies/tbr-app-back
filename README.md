# To-Be-Read App Back End

This project will cover the middle and back layers for my mobile app 'to-be-read'. It will consist of a Maven Spring Boot layer that will communicate with the Goodreads API, and also communicate with the database I create which will store details on other details I store, such as books and releases that aren't on Goodreads.
For the First release of the app I will use RestTemplate, however as this will be deprecated by Spring in future release, I will eventually look into other methods.
